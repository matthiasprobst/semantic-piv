    Image A001_1.tif and A001_2.tif were recorded at the DNW-LLF in order
    to study experimentally the wake vortex formation behind a transport
    aircraft (DLR ALVAST half model) in landing configuration (U=60 m/s,
    main flow direction is perpendicular to the light-sheet plane). The
    measurement position was 1.64 m behind the wing tip and the field of
    view is 170 mm by 140 mm. The images were selected as strong gradients,
    loss of image density, and varying particle image sizes are common
    problems for many PIV applications in large wind tunnels.
